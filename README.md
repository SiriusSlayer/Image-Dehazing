# Image Dehazing Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and results of our undergraduate project on Image Dehazing. We have implemented and evaluated state-of-the-art algorithms such as ChaIR and FFANet using Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

## Algorithms Evaluated
1. **ChaIR**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Image Restoration method specifically designed for single image dehazing.
2. **FFANet**: Feature Fusion Attention Network (FFANet) is a deep learning model that uses a fusion attention mechanism to selectively fuse multi-level features for image dehazing.

## Installation
The installation process and Testing can be accessed through The Individual Folders.
## Results
Our evaluation shows that both ChaIR and FFANet perform well on our proprietary datasets. The detailed results and comparisons are available in the results directory.
